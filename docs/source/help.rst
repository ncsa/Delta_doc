   <p>For <b>all other issues</b>, regardless of allocation type, please <b>submit a support request</b> by emailing <a href="mailto:help@ncsa.illinois.edu?subject=Delta: ">help@ncsa.illinois.edu</a>. Your email will initiate a ticket that NCSA staff will use to help you.</p>

**To help NCSA staff efficiently address your request, in your initial email, please include:**

- A descriptive subject line starting with **Delta** (for example, "Delta: srun isn't working.")
- In the email body, include:
  
  - The UserID you use to log into the system.
  - The name of the allocation account that you use to submit jobs.
  - Approximately when (date/time) the issue occurred.
  - What you were trying to do and how you tried to do it.
  - Why you think it isn’t working.
  - Commands or scripts you ran, in enough detail to reproduce the problem (text files are preferred).
  - The output and/or error messages you got (text files are preferred).
  - Did you install any modules? If so, which ones? (run **module list** and paste the output into the message)
  - If your command or script worked in the past, when did it stop working?
  - Any other approaches you’ve tried.
  - Any other information you think might be relevant.

System users can often fix problems or help diagnose them on their own.  Please do a search for your problem (in the search box at the upper left of this documentation page is a good place, but so is Google) and try the solutions you find if they seem applicable and reasonable.  Please let us know what you tried, and if it didn't seem to work, what happened. 

**If you have multiple, unrelated issues, please create a separate ticket for each by sending separate emails.**

You will receive email correspondence as your ticket is worked on, please respond to any questions that are asked.
