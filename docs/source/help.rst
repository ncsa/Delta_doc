Getting Help
================

- For ACCESS allocations issues, create a ticket via the `ACCESS Help page <https://support.access-ci.org/open-a-ticket>`_.

- For all other issues, regardless of allocation type, please submit a support request by emailing help@ncsa.illinois.edu.   
  
  - Include "Delta" in the email subject along with an explanatory name for your problem.  
  - In the body of the email, include as many details as possible. It is generally helpful to include what you're trying to do, error output (as text, not images), and a list of modules you had loaded at the time the error occurred (run "module list" and paste the output into the message), and any other relevant information.  
  - Include your Delta username and the name of the allocation account that you use to submit jobs.
