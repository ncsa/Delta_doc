Getting Help
================

ACCESS Allocations
---------------------

For ACCESS allocation issues, create a ticket via the `ACCESS Help page <https://support.access-ci.org/open-a-ticket>`_ (ACCESS log in required). You can browse other ACCESS support resources on the `ACCESS Support page <https://support.access-ci.org>`_ (ACCESS log in *not* required).

NAIRR Pilot Projects
----------------------

For issues specific to NAIRR Pilot projects awarded time on Delta, please submit your issues to NAIRR Pilot support by emailing usersupport@support.nairrpilot.org.

Explore Solutions
-------------------

The following are strategies to try before you submit a support request:

- Search the documentation for relevant keywords using the search box in the upper left.
  Also try the search box on the `NCSA Documentation Hub <https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_; this will return keyword results from *all* of the NCSA user documentation sets.

- If you're getting an error, perform a web search of the error message (Google, Bing, or others).
- If you're looking for a package, perform a web search for "how do I install <package name>" and try the solutions you find that seem applicable and reasonable.  

When you submit a support request, please let us know what you tried, and what happened if it didn't seem to work.
