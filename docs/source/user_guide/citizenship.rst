Good Cluster Citizenship
============================

**You share Delta with thousands of other users.** 
What you do on the system affects others. 
Exercise good citizenship to ensure your activity does not adversely impact the system and the research community with whom you share it. 
Here are some rules of thumb:

-  Do not run production jobs on the login nodes (very short time debug tests are fine).
-  Do not stress file systems with known-harmful access patterns (many thousands of small files in a single directory).
-  If you encounter an issue, :ref:`submit an informative support request <help>`; include the loaded modules (module list) and stdout/stderr messages in your email.
