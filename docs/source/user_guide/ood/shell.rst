How to Log into the OOD Shell Interface
========================================

A shell interface is available in OOD; there are two options to access this interface.

Option 1 - Direct Navigate
---------------------------

   #. Navigate to the `Open OnDemand shell interface <https://openondemand.delta.ncsa.illinois.edu/pun/sys/shell/ssh/dt-login>`_.
   #. If prompted, Log in through CILogon with your **NCSA** username, password, and Duo MFA.
   #. Enter your **NCSA** password in the terminal interface prompt and hit **enter (return)**. 

      .. note::
         The terminal will *not* show your password (or placeholder symbols such as asterisks [*]) as you type.
