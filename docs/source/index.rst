Introduction
=============

Delta is a dedicated, `ACCESS <https://access-ci.org>`_-allocated resource designed by HPE and NCSA, delivering a highly capable GPU-focused compute environment for GPU and CPU workloads.  
In addition to offering a mix of standard and reduced precision GPU resources, Delta also offers GPU-dense nodes with both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.  
Delta provides high performance node-local SSD scratch filesystems, as well as both standard Lustre and relaxed-POSIX parallel filesystems spanning the entire resource.

Envisioned to lead change across the dimensions of computing, storage, and usability, Delta employs standards-based, fully customized science gateways with per-domain interfaces provided alongside the traditional command-line batch system interface. 
Enabled science gateways seamlessly integrate Delta into the cyberinfrastructure ecosystem alongside other resources to enable complex, multi-system workflows. 
To advance applications, the Delta project team continues the applications-focused, outcomes-oriented approach to drive the transition to GPU-accelerated applications alongside gateway-based productivity advances. 
Integrated with the NSF's Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support (ACCESS) ecosystems, Delta leverages the substantial portfolio of services and support offered therein and together deliver unprecedented advances in researcher productivity.

Delta supports the `ACCESS core software stack <https://access-ci.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ACCESSdocumentation/pages/72421302>`_, including remote login, remote computation, data movement, science workflow support, and science gateway support toolkits.

Getting Started with High-Performance Computing
================================================

**There are no specific prerequisite courses or high-performance computing (HPC) experience required before using Delta.** However, if you are unfamiliar with using an HPC cluster, it is highly recommended that you take NCSAâ€™s short tutorial `Using an HPC Cluster for Scientific Applications <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/enrol/index.php?id=71>`_ before continuing.

You can also browse the full list of NCSA's `HPC-Moodle Self-Paced Tutorials <https://www.hpc-training.org/xsede/moodle/course/index.php?categoryid=11>`_ to learn more about other HPC topics.
