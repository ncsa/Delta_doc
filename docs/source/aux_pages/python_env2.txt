Recent Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To address a problem with ``PATH`` ordering when using anaconda3
modules, a warning in the module was put in place to caution loading an
anaconda3 module while in a virtual environment, or if ``conda init``
has been used to modify one's environment.

::

   (base) [arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ module load anaconda3_gpu
   A conda environment has been detected CONDA_PREFIX=
   /sw/external/python/anaconda3 
   anaconda3_gpu is loaded. Consider running conda deactivate and reloading it.

see also:
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/configuration.html , if
you want to disable automatic conda environment activation

Batch Jobs
~~~~~~~~~~

Batch jobs will honor the commands you execute within them.
Purge/unload/load modules, or deactivate/activate environments as needed
for that job.

A clean slate job might resemble:

::

   conda deactivate
   conda deactivate  # just making sure
   module purge
   module reset  # load the default Delta modules

   conda activate base
   # commands to load modules and activate environs

Non-python/conda HPC users would see per-job stderr from the *conda
deactivate* above:

::

   [arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ conda deactivate
   bash: conda: command not found
   [arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ 

   # or

   [arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ conda deactivate

   CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda deactivate'.
   To initialize your shell, run

       $ conda init 

   Currently supported shells are:
     - bash
     - fish
     - tcsh
     - xonsh
     - zsh
     - powershell

   See 'conda init --help' for more information and options.

   IMPORTANT: You may need to close and restart your shell after running 'conda init'.

Jupyter with Open OnDemand
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jupyter and jupyter-lab will find the environments in your
$HOME/.conda/envs -- your login shell should reflect what you want to
see from Jupyter.

The list of avail. kernels for Jupyter should be the same as what you
see from a login shell and python3 (
https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels ).

**Jupyter needs to be installed in every virtual environment where you
want to use with Jupyter-lab or Jupyter-notebook.**

**$ conda install jupyter**

::

   [arnoldg@dt-login03 jupyter_notebook_config.d]$ python3 -m nb_conda_kernels list

Of interest are the Searching path at the beginning, and the
nb_conda_kernels outputs.
