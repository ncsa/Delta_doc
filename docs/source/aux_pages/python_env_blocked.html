<h3>Recent Changes</h3>
<p>To address a problem with <code>PATH</code> ordering when using anaconda3 modules, a warning in the module was put in place to caution loading an anaconda3 
module while in a virtual environment, or if <code>conda init</code> has been used to modify one's environment.</p>
<pre>
(base) [arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ module load anaconda3_gpu
A conda environment has been detected CONDA_PREFIX=
/sw/external/python/anaconda3 
anaconda3_gpu is loaded. Consider running conda deactivate and reloading it.
</pre>

<p>see also: <a 
href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/configuration.html">https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/configuration.html</a>&nbsp; , if you 
want to disable automatic conda environment activation</p>
<h3>Batch Jobs</h3>
<p>Batch jobs will honor the commands you execute within them.&nbsp; Purge/unload/load modules, or deactivate/activate environments as needed for that job.</p>
<p>A clean slate job might resemble:</p>
<pre>
conda deactivate
conda deactivate  # just making sure
module purge
module reset  # load the default Delta modules

conda activate base
# commands to load modules and activate environs

</pre>

<p>Non-python/conda HPC users would see per-job stderr from the <em>conda deactivate</em> above:</p>
<pre>
[arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ conda deactivate
bash: conda: command not found
[arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ 

# or

[arnoldg@dt-login03 ~]$ conda deactivate

CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda deactivate'.
To initialize your shell, run

    $ conda init <SHELL_NAME>

Currently supported shells are:
  - bash
  - fish
  - tcsh
  - xonsh
  - zsh
  - powershell

See 'conda init --help' for more information and options.

IMPORTANT: You may need to close and restart your shell after running 'conda init'.

</pre>

<h3>Jupyter with Open OnDemand</h3>
<p>Jupyter and jupyter-lab will find the environments in your $HOME/.conda/envs -- your login shell should reflect what you want to see from 
Jupyter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list of avail. kernels for Jupyter should be the same as what you see from a login shell and python3 ( <a 
href="https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels">https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda_kernels</a> ).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jupyter needs to be installed in every virtual environment where you want to use with Jupyter-lab or Jupyter-notebook.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"><strong>$ conda install jupyter</strong></p>
<pre>
