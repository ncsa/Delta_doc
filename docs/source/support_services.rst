Support and Services
======================

This page lists topics that have specific infrastructure on the system to support. If you have any further questions about these topics please submit a support request (:ref:`help`).

General Support
----------------

Traditional service requests for assistance on accessing and allocation issues, porting codes, debugging, and software requests are handled through the ticket system; see :ref:`help` for informatino on how to submit a support reqeust. Issues will be reviewed for estimated level of effort and scope of the request (impacts only one user, impacts an entire group, or impacts broader community).

Requests requiring deeper engagement will need additional review and potentially funded work. Examples of such requests would be implementation of new algorithms or existing algorithms in a new language (e.g. from Matlab to Python), performance profiling and tuning. Please submit a support reqeust to initiate a conversation.
