Support and Services
======================

Traditional service requests for assistance on access and allocation issues, porting codes, debugging, and software requests are handled through the ticket system; see :ref:`help` for information on how to submit a support request. Issues will be reviewed for estimated level of effort and scope of the request (impacts only one user, impacts an entire group, or impacts the broader community).

Requests requiring deeper engagement will need additional review and potentially funded work. For additional support opportunities, please see:

- `ACCESS MATCHPlus <https://support.access-ci.org/matchplus>`_ for short-term support.
- `ACCESS MATCHPremier <https://support.access-ci.org/matchpremier>`_ for long-term support.
- `Illinois Computes <https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/illinois-computes>`_ for partnerships between University of Illinois researchers and NCSA.
