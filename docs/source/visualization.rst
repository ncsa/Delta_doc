Visualization
=====================

Delta A40 nodes support NVIDIA raytracing hardware.

Paraview (Client/Server)
---------------------------

https://engaging-web.mit.edu/eofe-wiki/software/paraview_client_server_mode/

Seems **broken currently**, when setting up ssh tunnel as shown, get
this on the client side:

::

   Connection failed during handshake. 
   vtkSocketCommunicator::GetVersion()
    returns different values on the two connecting processes
    (Current value: 100).

| 

At least one site does not support client-server anymore (due to issues
like this):

pvpython and pvbatch work and are available:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Suggest: https://www.paraview.org/Wiki/PvPython_and_PvBatch and using
just the pvbatch part of paraview:

::

   [arnoldg@dt-login02 ~]$ cd paraview_pvbatch/
   [arnoldg@dt-login02 paraview_pvbatch]$ vi greenSphere.py  # sample from URL above for pvpython
   [arnoldg@dt-login02 paraview_pvbatch]$ pvpython greenSphere.py 
   [arnoldg@dt-login02 paraview_pvbatch]$ ls
   greenSphere.py  greenSphereScreenshot.png

Visit Client & Server
-------------------------

Following:
https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/tutorials1/visit.html

Here are the screenshots for using Delta in a similar way:

pick a unique login node, .bashrc on delta

Choose either dt-login01 or dt-login02 (not dt-login) to keep ssh tunnel
connections working smoothly.

Be sure to ssh to that login node **before** you proceed (if you have
not logged into it before). Visit cannot deal with the initial login
confirmation of a new host key.

Add to your $HOME/.bashrc (for the remote visit gui):

module load visit

Adjust Maximum processors to fit your requirements.

The "-interactive" version of a partition is shown. Note those
partitions are for quick tests up to 30 minutes. Choose another
partition for longer sessions.

Partitions and accounts should match: gpu partitions go with gpu account
endings, cpu partitions with cpu account endings.

Proceeding with the tutorial, this is the view from the client and
noise.silo example (found in the visit installation data/) ...
